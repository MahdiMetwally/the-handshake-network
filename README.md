# The Handshake Network  
**Unlocking connections, one handshake at a time.**

---

## **Project Description**  
The Handshake Network is an AI-powered system designed to explore and map relationships through the detection and identification of handshakes in images and videos. By leveraging cutting-edge computer vision and facial recognition technologies, this project identifies individuals involved in handshakes and creates a network of connections.

---

## **Core Features**
1. **Handshake Detection**:  
   Detect and validate handshake gestures in images and videos using advanced pose estimation and CNN models.
   
2. **Facial Recognition**:  
   Identify individuals involved in the handshake using state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms.

3. **Connection Mapping**:  
   Build and visualize a relationship network based on handshake interactions using graph databases.

4. **Data-Driven Insights**:  
   Query the network to uncover patterns, mutual connections, or extended relationships up to "handshake degrees."

## **Use Cases**
- **Event Analysis**: Understand connections formed during networking events, summits, or ceremonies.
- **Media Research**: Analyze public interactions among politicians, celebrities, or business leaders.
- **Social Graph Exploration**: Visualize the handshake network of a person to understand indirect relationships.
